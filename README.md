# Malcolm's Anatomy: SmartHealth

**Malcolm's Anatomy: SmartHealth** is an AI-powered health education platform designed to improve health literacy by providing personalized health tips, answering user questions, and delivering educational content in text, images, and videos. The platform aims to make reliable health information accessible to all, with language localization and voice interaction for enhanced accessibility.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Health Assistant**: Users can ask health-related questions about symptoms, conditions, or preventive measures, and the AI will respond with information sourced from trusted medical organizations (WHO, CDC, etc.).
- **Personalized Health Content**: The platform tailors health tips, reminders, and information based on user data (age, health conditions, geography).
- **Voice Interaction**: Users can interact with the platform using voice queries, which are converted into text and answered by the AI system.
- **Educational Media**: Health content is delivered through text, images, and short videos to enhance understanding and engagement.
- **Chatbot Integration**: A chatbot assists users with frequently asked questions (FAQs) on health topics.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: Built using ReactJS for a responsive and intuitive user experience.
- **Backend**: Powered by Django for managing APIs and integrating AI models.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Using spaCy or NLTK for understanding user queries, and potentially pre-trained models like GPT or BERT for more advanced language processing.
- **Machine Learning**: Personalized health content and recommendations are powered by scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
- **Chatbot**: Rasa or Dialogflow for implementing the chatbot feature.
- **Voice Interaction**: Googleâ€™s Speech-to-Text API or Web Speech API for handling voice-based queries.
